[Giant molecular cloud scaling relations: the role of the cloud definition](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/455/2/1782/1110327)

Simulate three types of galaxies with no prefered structure, spiral barred and flocculent structure and analyse the GMC formed. THe cloud definition is either by (CLUMPFIND) CF method and (COLUMN DENSITY) CDN approach.

1. mass, luminosity and others physical params are simular are closed to observations, parameters depend of CD method.
2. diffuse gas with high velocity dispersion and lower CO line brighthess might overstimate the 1D velocity dispersion in dense large scale structures.
3. CF shows smaller size, mass and velocity dispersion, however the virial parameters are closed.
4. statisically insensible of scaling relations between galaxies for a given CD.
